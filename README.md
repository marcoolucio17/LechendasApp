# Biomonitoring app

## Overview 

The Biomonitoring App is a mobile application designed for the monitoring and conservation of species in environmentally vulnerable areas. It allows users, particularly in rural zones, to register sightings of flora and fauna, track environmental conditions, and share data with other users and researchers. The app works offline, syncing data once internet access is available.
